I often get a little bored and I look for new challenges to get my mind working.

I recently discovered static site generators. The whole idea behind a ssg is that it loads insanely fast. It doesn’t have a huge database and backend to process. It’s all basically just one page of code. I looked at a few static sites and they loaded almost instantaneously on my horrible internet at home.

I had to try it.

So I found something called Jekyll. It’s a static site generator that has a layer for blogging on it. I’m trying it out now and I really like it.

The advantage of Jekyll is that you can host it for free on Github. It has almost no storage needs really online. The websites are super lightweight. At one point Whitehouse.gov was built using Jekyll. I’m not sure if it still is, but at one point it was because it’s also more secure. 

I’ve got my site up and running, but I’m still trying to figure out how to customize themes and templates. It’s a little tricky and I’m trying to learn new terms.
